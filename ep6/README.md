### 🔍 What is virtualenv?
virtualenv is a tool that lets you create isolated Python environments. This means you can have separate sets of Python packages for different projects without conflicts.

1. Install virtualenv:
```bash
pip install your-package-name
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m virtualenv venv
```
