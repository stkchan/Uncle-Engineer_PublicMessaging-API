### üîç What is virtualenv?
virtualenv is a tool that lets you create isolated Python environments. This means you can have separate sets of Python packages for different projects without conflicts.

1. Install virtualenv:
   ```bash
   pip install your-package-name
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m virtualenv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
4. Deactivate it when you're done:
   ```bash
      deactivate
   ```
